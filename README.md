# Trouble_Shooting_Code
These are examples of broken algorithms that I have turned into code and edited so that it can achieve the original purpose.

Each of these files is independent from one another. 
The original algorithms from these code fragments were from different HSC exams, and as part of learning more about the code I was analysing, I took it upon myself to create the code. 

Each of these are examples of basic coding and are not a representation of my overall coding ability
